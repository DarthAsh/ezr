# Easier  AI (just the important bits)

The SE and AI literature is full of bold experiments
that try a range of new ideas.  But some new ideas are better than
others. With all little time, and lots of implementation experience,
we can focus of which  ideas offer the "most bang per buck".

I say all this since, for over two decades, I have been mentoring people about SE and AI.
When you do that, after a while, you realize:

- When it is all said and done, you only need  a dozen or so cool tricks;
- Other people really only need a  few dozen or so bits of AI theory;
- Everyone  could have more fun, and get more done, if we avoided
  the same dozen or so traps.

So I decided to write down that theory and those tricks and    traps
(see below).  I took some XAI code (explainable AI) I'd written for
semi-supervised multiple-objective optimization. Then I wrote notes
on any part of the code where  I had spent time helping helping
people with  those tricks, theory and traps.
